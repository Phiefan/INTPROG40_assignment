Sorry in advance! Been awhile since I wrote in English.

First and foremost, if you reading this is my examinator: BranchOne is the implementation of part 2 of the assignment and BranchTwo is the further developed version for part 3.

This program is the submisson of the final assignment of the course INTPRO40 (Introduction to programming) of the Software tester program of EC Utbildning.

The purpose of the program is to read text, line for line, from the terminal until the user writes stop 
whereupon the result, aka how many rows of text been read and how many characters these rows included, will be printed.

The program consists of two classes:
  - A class that reads in from the terminal and writes the result
  - A class that counts the rows and the characters

In the first implementation of this program the check of whether the user has written stop can be implemented in either of the aboved mentioned classes.

To this program a minimum of three Junit testcases must be written. They must be differentiated from each other and test different parts of the program.

In the second implementation, the program shall also write out the amount of words that's been read and what the longest word is. 
Furthermore, the check of whether the user has written stop must be implemented in the class that counts the rows and the characters (and the new stuff).
